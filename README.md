# Introduction

* This repo consits of an nginx.conf configuration file for Nginx. A ready-made configuration file which can be used for small **PHP** websites only.

* There is also commands.txt file which has the list of commands that are necessary to trigger before you save the Nginx configurations and reload Nginx to reflect the changes.

# Notes

* The configuration file is still in progress to make it more and more robust and error free at the time of reload or checking nginx syntex.

* There will be different versions and with it the commands.txt file will also be updated. Will recommend to use the latest version of the configuration file always.
